        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Hanane, and I am from Morocco. It my 5<sup>th</sup> years in Canada. I hold a <abbr
                title="Bachelor of Business Administartion">BBA</abbr> but have never worked because I was a full-time
            mom to my three beautiful kids.
            Recently, I decided to return to study after 13 years, and my kids are very proud of me. It's certainly
            challenging, but mothers are accustomed to facing daily challenges, and education is one of them.
            <em><strong>I will do my best to succeed</strong></em>.</p>
        <p>When I decided to come back to college, I chose a program completely different from what I studied before. I
            was seeking something that would allow my artistic side to shine. I aspire to have a career filled with
            creativity and beauty, which led me to choose <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>. Another
            reason for this choice is the hope for more remote job options as a freelance worker, enabling me to take
            care of my kids while working at the same time.</p>
